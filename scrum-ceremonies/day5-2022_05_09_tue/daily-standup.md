# Daily Standup Report

## Wazzup?
> Yesterday I…, today I will…, I need help with…, I'm stuck with…, TIL…

### Hanna
Yesterday I added functionality to the voting cards, so that all users can vote on the current task. I learned about Map and how it can store key value pairs. Today I will try to pussle how to emit with socket the average score to admins input field. I might need help with this because I will need to write code in someone elses code. I am not stuck :) (yet) 

### Alexander
Yesterday we had a retro for the last sprint. After that I worked on functionality for rendering current task and calculating the score.  Today I will work on deploying the app. I might need help with the deploying workflow. 

### Robin
Yesterday we had retro meeting and the group agreed that we have a good group dynamic. I added a end session button to the admin view so that the admin can end session and logout all users. This task took longer than i expected as it as set to half a day but i might have taken almost the whole day. I learned more about socket functions which is a good thing. Today i will add a message to all users that the session is ending with a countdown before returning to login screen.

### Nani
Yesterday, we had a really successful retrospective meeting. There were some excellent reflections and discussions. In addition, I spent some time yesterday rendering all the user cards after they had been voted on, and I tried to add a simple flip animation that sort of works. Today, my plan is to ensure that my animation works properly and then select an issue to work on to help us complete the project. Maybe I'll need some help with the animation!
