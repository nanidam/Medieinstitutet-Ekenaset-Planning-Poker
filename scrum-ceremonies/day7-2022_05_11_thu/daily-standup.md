### Hanna

Yesterday I we worked together to code so that the unrated tasks move into the rated tasks lists after being rated. I also added meta tags for SEO. Today I will work on the login page to add some (dry) humor. I am not stuck with anything at the moment :)

### Robin

Yesterday i worked on a function that only render the vote cards when a task i voted on, today i will focus on fixing that the function is emitted to all users with help from the group.

### Nani

Yesterday, I participated in a group coding session after the scrum ceremony meeting. After that, I quickly added a README for the application. Today, I will be sitting with the group to refactor and clean up the code together. Afterwards, I will simply fix a few minor styling issues.

### Alexander

Yesterday I finished the workflow for deploying on Digital Ocean when code is pushed to main branch. We also merged som pull requests together. Today the group will clean up the code together.
