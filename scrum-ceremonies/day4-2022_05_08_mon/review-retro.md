# Review & Retro

### GLAD
We have had good communication, we have worked together a lot and it have been going great. The group dynamic have been good as well, we complete each other.
The stories have been properly broken down, balanced and accurately rated and prioritized Last week we did 22 SP, which is 5,5 SP each, and we worked two full work days.

### SAD
We worked together a lot the past week, and because we wanted to get a good start we skipped taking breaks and had long meetings just to get things done. We should have taken breaks even though we didn't feel like it.

### MAD
The project felt too large to handle in a week and a half in the beginning. The first days we needed to plan and structure together which led to it felt like a couple of days went "lost", because we couldn't start to code. It felt like working agile took up a little too much time, and getting a good grade came in second hand.
