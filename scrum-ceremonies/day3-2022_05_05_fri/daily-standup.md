> Yesterday I…, today I will…, I need help with…, I'm stuck with…, TIL…

### Hanna
Yesterday we built the template for the project in both front and back end. We have broken down the site into components and built the structure so can work on the individual components with minimal conflicts. Today I will choose an issue from the current sprint and start coding! I don't think I will get stuck during today because we have built such a beautiful base :)

### Robin
Yesterday we set the structure for the user main page. Today i will focus on the log out user function.

### Alexander
Yesterday we worked on the base structure for renderering the game page. Today I will work on rendering the unrated tasks list.

### Name 4
Yesterday, we worked together on the structure of the project. However, I was unable to sit with the group for the entire meeting. After the structure of the project was finalized, I started working on the voting cards. Today, I plan to complete the voting cards and create a PR.
