# Review & Retro

### GLAD
We're really happy that everything has went really well!
We all have our strong traits that we bring together to the team and we all complete each other. Everybody has been on board on the agile thought of train and we have welcomed this way of working with open arms. We have a "we" perspective and not an "I" perspective. There was never any confusion in who did what and how we should go on with an issue.
We think part of our effectiveness was part to us using the scrum methods and giving planning such a big part of the start of the project.

### SAD
It's an end of an era :( And we're sad that its over!
We would have liked that this course was even earlier, if not the whole course at least parts of it. It would have helped earlier group projects a lot, only using the github projects board for example.

### MAD
We should have made a socket flow chart, this would've given us a overview of the socket connection and how they should interact. It might have been hard to understand in the start how exactly the socket connection would work, so we might have needed to update it a few times during the project.
