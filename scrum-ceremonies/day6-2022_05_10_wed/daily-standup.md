### Alexander

Yesterday I worked on deploying the app on Digital Ocean and autodeploying on push. I learned alot about SSH-keys, Docker, Node environment and .yml-files. Today I will add the last settings for the app to autodeploy on push to main branch and fix som bugs in the app.

### Hanna

Yesterday I added the final rating to the input field, and moved some code into the correct folders. Today I will work together with the group to work to code what happens when admin accepted the rating. Since we work together we will hopefully help other to solve the problems we encounter :)

### Robin

Yesterday i added a function that emits a message to all users that admin is ending the session with a countdown before they are returned to the login scren. I also created a logo for the login page and a SVG logo for the main page. Today i will work with the group to make the rated task list update and render properly.

### Nani

Yesterday, I worked on styling the application using SASS and ensured that the proportions of the different components were appropriate. Today, I plan to participate in the group coding session where we will be focusing on completing the remaining tasks to finalize the happy flow of the application.
